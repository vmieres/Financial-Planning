#  **Tool for a personal financial planner and retirement planning**

 This repo is about creating a tool that helps people's assess their financial health. 
 
 Using the **Alpaca Markets API** to to pull historical stocks and bonds information and the **Alternative Free Crypto API** to retrieve Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.

 ### **The first Part is about a Personal Financial Planner**
 



The credit union board wants to allow the union's members to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.
In this homework activity, you will use all the skills you have learned until now - focusing on using APIs as part of the technical solution - to create two financial analysis tools.
The first will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.
The second tool will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. You will then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
